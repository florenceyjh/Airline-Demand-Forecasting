The purpose of the project was to predict airlineâ€™s final demands for 7 departure dates and days prior 1 to 28 on the validation data. The original training data was over 5000 observations, which includes variables like departure date, booking date and cumulative bookings. Our problem/objective was to minimize the forecast error (we used Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) to validate the outcome for this project).
